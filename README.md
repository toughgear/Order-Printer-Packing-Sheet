# Order Printer Packing Sheet

This is a version controlled repository of the order printer packing sheet for
the Survival Straps Shopify store. The goal was to reduce errors by highlighting
aspects of the packing sheet that are most important to production and shipping.

### Features
- Premium add-ons (Active Edge, gift wrapping, stainless closures, etc) are no
longer listed as their own line item
- High resolution logo with 13 strips on the flag, not just a blurry smear
- Large order number at the top of the page
- Verbose date and time
- High contrast line item listing
- Product thumbnails
- Priority shipping, quantities over 1, and line items that have premium
features are now displayed in **bold**
- Notes no longer print, so they can safely be used for internal documentation
